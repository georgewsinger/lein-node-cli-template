## :dependencies SE Post

Where do lein :dependencies and :plugins come from?

In a `project.clj`, when you see things like:

    :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure       "1.8.0"]
                   [org.clojure/clojurescript "1.7.228"]
                   [com.cemerick/piggieback "0.2.1"]
                   [org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.10"]
                   [org.clojure/core.async "0.2.374"]]


and:

    :plugins [[org.bodil/lein-noderepl "0.1.11"]
              [lein-cljsbuild           "1.1.2"]
              [lein-npm                 "0.6.1"]
              [lein-repls               "1.9.5"]
              [lein-doo                 "0.1.6"]]

1. Where are these packages they coming from? Is it solely Clojars and Maven? **Can Lein be configured to get them from GitHub as well?**
2. When these packages are added to your project, **is lein merely downloading them and adding them to your java class path?** Or something else happening as well?


Is it just adding these packages (from places like Maven and Clojars) to your java class path?

Where do they come from? Just Maven and Clojars? Can you get them directly from GitHub?
